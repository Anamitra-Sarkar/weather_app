# WeatherSphere

Welcome! This is a small project created by [Anamitra Sarkar](https://github.com/Anamitra-Sarkar) to practice frontend development, UI design, and working with third-party APIs. The app is called **WeatherSphere** and provides current weather information for any city, with a clean, modern interface and some AI-powered extras.

## Features

- **Live Weather Data:** Fetches current weather from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) for any city you enter.
- **Dynamic UI:** Responsive, glassmorphic card design with Tailwind CSS and custom backgrounds that change based on weather conditions.
- **Animated Effects:** Living backgrounds and subtle weather particle animations (rain, snow, etc.).
- **AI Briefing:** Get a smart summary of the weather using Google Gemini AI.
- **AI Stylist (weather1.html):** Get outfit advice based on current conditions (experimental).
- **Mobile Friendly:** Fully responsive for all device sizes.

## Demo

Just open `weather.html` or `weather1.html` in your browser and try searching for your favorite city!

> **Note:** No media uploads or user authentication required—it's a simple, fun frontend project.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anamitra-Sarkar/weather_app.git

   ```

2. **Open `weather.html` or `weather1.html` in your browser:**
   - No build step needed; it's pure HTML/CSS/JS.
